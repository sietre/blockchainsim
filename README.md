This is the code that runs a simulated block chain on a server in a VM setup by Professor Scott Yilek for the Advanced Information Security Final

I created modified the transactions to create interactivity across the profiles stored within the block chain and to test the validity of each interaction using the public and secret keys of each account

I modified the wallet to keep track of each user's coins and to mine coins to add to one of the user's coins

When run on the server, the code would allow the user to "be" any of the 5 users in the chain and complete full transactions while updating the chain in currchain text file.
